# TicTacToe-AI-Basys3
Tic Tac Toe using a 640x480 VGA display, the game is played against an A.I.

User input is taken from the switches on Basys3.
Beware that Basys3 has an internal clock frequency of 100 MHz, a different board would require a different clock division process to be compatible with the 640x480 display.

Although the romx is not used, address and data in romx.vhd can be used to change the boxes on VGA Display to characters.
